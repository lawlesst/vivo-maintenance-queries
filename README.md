#####Maintenance Queries, Automating the Identification and Resolution of
Problematic Data in VIVO

Presenters: Steven McCauley and Ted Lawless

After deploying VIVO, adopters will find that, overtime, data can become inconsistent, incomplete, or missing. This talk will focus on methods for identifying and resolving problematic data in an automated fashion. We will describe a reusable toolkit we have developed that utilizes SPARQL based rules for identifying data and VIVO's SPARQL API for updating, or correcting, these problems. Further, we will explain how web services are used to augment incomplete data. The toolkit and methods used will be extendable and reusable by other sites.
